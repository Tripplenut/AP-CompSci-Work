# AP CompSci Work

Just a place for all my work this year

## ALMini (Array List Mini Problems)

    This assignment was literally just a bunch of Array List problems. If I ever attach documents of the promts it will describe all of them. Today is not that day tho. To use it just uncomment the method you wanna see and input the values into the arraylist needed to make it run. You may need to change the Arraylist class type to <Integer> or <String> depending on the method you are using. One annoying this is it doesnt run multiple methods at once because it kind of breaks the list since things are constantly being altered or removed.

## CardGame

    This assignment was one where I had to create a deck of cards in order then create a method that shuffled and printed the deck.
    It was kinda cool and my introduction into Arraylist. Most useful thing in the world.
    To use it just run the code and it should shuffle a deck for you.
    If you want to shuffle more or just print the deck use the methods.

## ConnectFour

    This assignment was just making a Connect 4 game that you can play between 2 people. I worked on a project similar to this last year when it comes to the methods used to conduct the game but let me say the conditions for winning were pain. Nothing but Pain. I decided it was a smart idea to check every possible combination to see if the player won. Not only is this super inefficient but its also a pain to look at and understand. Other than that it was a solid project. Hoping we use GUI's later on cause looking at connect 4 with 1s and 2s was not how I want to spend my monday night.

## EscapeCharacter

    To be honest I barely understand this one myself. I just know I needed to format some information a certain way for what ever reason. The thing was I could only use tabs and not .format, painfully tedious.To use it just run the code. Not really a point of changing any values. 

## Inheritance

    This project was about inheritance and polymorphism. I had some previous understanding of it so grasping the concept wasn't difficult but the certain details of polymorphism like casing your object to compile in a certain class in the hierarchy was confusing initially but made sense the more your played with compiling errors and runtime errors. It was a tedious project but I know its definitely one of the more important ones I have done all year.

## LifeDriver(Game of Life)

    This assignment is based on John Conway's game of life. If you don't know much about it I would take a quick peak at this https://playgameoflife.com/ and also just looking it up. It wasn't crazy difficult to make as my teacher gave me the driver and told us what each method in Life was supposed to do. To use it just run the code, it will ask you how many generations you want and you input a number and each generation will pop. If you want to change the cells type your own in or use some of the premade ones at the bottom.

## MagicSquares

    This was a cool project that I actually had to use my brain for. It involved creating a magic square using serious of if statements and inputing all the information into a matrix. It was my introduction into matrices, It was a good way to start that still involved previous knowledge. To use it just input an positive odd number of any size. The larger the better imo. Look up what a magic square is to get a better understanding of what your looking at also.

## MatrixMultiplication

    This project was a pain in the ass trying to do the math but actually coding it was simple. I don't really know how to explain how it works so maybe when I upload the files for the projects it will make sense. For now a youtube video will have to do https://youtu.be/2spTnAiQg4M 

## MazeRecursion

    This project was about solving a char matrix maze filled with astrixs and white spaces. The start was the center and you needed to figure out all the conditions to find the most optimal solution for each exit. It was a pretty simple project and I commented most of it so it could make sense in the future because I hate recursion. To use it just hit run or change up with matrix if you wanna see it with different solutions and stuff, just keep the center(5,5) blank or change it.

## SortsnSearches

    This project was about Sorts and Searches. We learned how to code Insertion, Selection and Merge Sort. Merge Sort was nothing but pain to understand at first but I got it down. The searches were Linear and Binary, I kind of wanted to do a jump search for fun but I got bored and started doing other work. Overall it was a pretty good project. May expand upon this list one day and just drop a bunch of different searches. To use just press run and if you want to change stuff check the comments in the main method.

## Text

    I think this project was for like html conversion or something, I dont really know. To use it just change the inputs in the main method, There's text in there as an example.

## TowerOfHanoi

    This assignment is based on the Tower of Hanoi. It solves the tower of hanoi problem thing, you know what im talking about. It was annoying to trace but I ended up getting it to work. If you would like to test this out yourself go ahead and open up a tower of hanoi game or click this link. https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html
