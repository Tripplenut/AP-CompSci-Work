# AP CompSci Work
 Just a place for all my work this year

 ALMini (Array List Mini Problems)-
    This assignment was litterally just a bunch of Array List problems. If I ever attach documents 
    of the promts it will describe all of them. Today is not that day tho.
    To use it just uncomment the method you wanna see and input the values into the arraylist needed to make it run.
    You may need to change the Arraylist class type to <Integer> or <String> depending on the method you are using.
    One annoying this is it doesnt run multiple methods at once because it kind of breaks the list since things are constantly being altered or removed.

CardGame-
    This assignment was one where I had to create a deck of cards in order then create a method that shuffled and printed the deck.
    It was kinda cool and my introduction into Arraylist. Most useful thing in the world.
    To use it just run the code and it should shuffle a deck for you.
    If you want to shuffle more or just print the deck use the methods.

EscapeCharacter-
    To be honest I barely understand this one myself.
    I just know I needed to format some information a certain way for what ever reason.
    The thing was I could only use tabs and not .format, painfully tedious.
    To use it just run the code. Not really a point of changing any values.

MagicSquares-
    This was a cool project that I actually had to use my brain for.
    It involved creating a magic square using serious of if statements and inputing all the information into a matrix.
    It was my introduction into matrices, It was a good way to start that still involved previous knowledge.
    To use it just input an positive odd number of any size. The larger the better imo.
    Look up what a magic square is to get a better understanding of what your looking at also.

Text-
    I think this project was for like html conversion or something, I dont really know.
    To use it just change the inputs in the main method, There's text in there as an example.
